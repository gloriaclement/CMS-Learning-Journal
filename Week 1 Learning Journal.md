## ﻿Week 1 -Learning  Journal


Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I built a simple 3-page website from scratch to get a feel for what it’s like to create a website without using modern CMS tools. It also served as a great opportunity to refresh my memory on how to use an AWS EC2 instance to host a website. In addition, I watched the LinkedIn Learning video Introduction to Web Design and Development, which was an excellent refresher on topics I’ve previously learned, such as web design, programming, and design thinking

# Estimated Hours
I spent approximately 2 hours building the website and 6 hours troubleshooting and successfully hosting it using AWS. I watched the LinkedIn Learning videos in short segments while commuting to university and back home during the week.

# Content Insights
Building a website from scratch significantly refreshed my understanding of HTML, CSS, and server-side hosting—skills I first learned during my initial year as an IT student.

# Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Completing this practical gave me greater confidence in using AWS to host a website. It also motivated me to explore additional AWS learning resources and consider pursuing AWS certification as a way to enhance my technical skills and career prospects.

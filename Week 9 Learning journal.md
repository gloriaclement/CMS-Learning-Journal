# Week 9 – Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources
In Week 9, I focused on Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) and experimented with building a simple website that was not based on WordPress. The task required demonstrating Sass fundamentals such as variables, nesting, mixins, and extend/inheritance. I set up a suitable workflow to automate the compilation of SCSS into CSS, ensuring my workflow reflected professional practices. I created an original HTML page and connected it with my Sass stylesheet, applying structured styling rules. My SCSS file included variables for consistent colour schemes, nesting for logical organisation of selectors, mixins to reuse common CSS properties (e.g., flexbox layout), and extend/inheritance for shared styling across multiple elements. This approach highlighted the efficiency and maintainability benefits of Sass compared to plain CSS.

## Estimated Hours
- Approx. 24 hours (including setup, coding, testing, and refining workflow).

## Content Insights
The exercise revealed the power of Sass in managing larger or more complex styling projects. Variables streamlined colour and typography management, allowing for easy global changes. Nesting reduced repetition and provided clear hierarchy in styles, making the stylesheet more readable. Mixins allowed me to avoid duplicating code for recurring patterns such as vendor-prefixed properties or layout rules. Extend/inheritance was particularly useful for keeping the code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), enabling multiple elements to share a common style base. Overall, I learned how automation tools can enhance efficiency by compiling SCSS into CSS seamlessly, a skill transferable to real-world development workflows.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
From a career perspective, gaining confidence in Sass strengthens my employability in front-end and full-stack roles where modern CSS practices are standard. Employers value developers who can produce maintainable, scalable stylesheets, and Sass provides that advantage. The ability to use variables, nesting, mixins, and extend not only saves time but also demonstrates professional coding habits. This week’s learning also built on previous weeks (CSS and WordPress styling), showing me how SCSS can integrate into different environments, from simple static sites to CMS platforms. Developing this workflow prepares me to contribute effectively to professional projects and adapt quickly to team-based development environments.

# Week 6 – Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week focused on setting up the collaborative infrastructure for our team project. As a group, we established key platforms for communication, version control, and project management. We created a GitHub repository using the provided GitHub Classroom link to manage our version control. One team member created a Trello board by copying the template and making it public, then added all team members for visibility and task assignment.
We are also using Discord (in place of Slack, as agreed by the group) for direct communication and real-time progress tracking. Our Trello board will includes a “Group Agreement” that outlines our expectations, contact details, and initial role distribution. Integration steps were also followed to connect GitHub and Trello to our communication platform for streamlined alerts and updates.

## Estimated Hours
30 minutes  – setup of Github, Trello and Discord/Slack
15 minutes - discussions and task distribution amongst team memebers

## Content Insights
This week’s tasks helped me understand the importance of structured collaboration in a team development environment. GitHub is not just for storing code — it enables real-time version control, branching, and safe collaboration. Trello provided a flexible way to plan, assign, and track tasks visually. The group agreement and onboarding process helped align our team’s goals and communication preferences early on, which is crucial to avoid confusion during development. I also learned how integrations can centralize project notifications, making it easier to stay updated without constantly switching between platforms.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
These activities reflect real-world team workflows in software development. Knowing how to use GitHub for version control, Trello (or GitHub Projects) for task management, and communication platforms like Discord or Slack is essential for both remote and on-site collaboration. Understanding tool integration is also a valuable skill that increases productivity and reduces the risk of miscommunication. Participating in setting up these systems gave me insight into the planning phase of a project — a stage often underestimated but vital for a successful outcome.

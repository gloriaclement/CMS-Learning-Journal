# Week 5 – Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I focused on developing a child theme in WordPress, specifically using the Astra theme as the parent. I created a custom folder titled Cake It Child Theme and added the required style.css and functions.php files to initialize the child theme. My learning was supported by official WordPress Developer documentation, Astra tutorials, and guidance from ChatGPT to ensure I followed best practices when enqueuing styles and customizing template files like header.php. I also experimented with overriding default styles and adding simple PHP functionality.
## Estimated Hours
6 hours – This included setting up the child theme structure, testing changes, reading documentation, debugging styling issues, and editing templates.


## Content Insights
I learned how child themes serve as a safe and effective method to customize WordPress themes without modifying the core parent theme. This ensures updates to the parent theme won’t override my changes. I gained hands-on experience writing a properly formatted style.css file with theme headers and using wp_enqueue_scripts in functions.php to load both parent and child styles. Additionally, I explored how to override parts of a theme by copying and modifying template files such as header.php. A key insight was understanding that file structure and load order matter — misplacing code or forgetting to enqueue parent styles correctly caused visible issues until resolved.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week’s experience strengthened my practical web development skills in a real-world CMS environment. Knowing how to build and manage a child theme is an essential competency for WordPress development roles and freelance website customization work. It also highlighted the importance of working within scalable, update-safe practices — a key requirement in any professional development setting. I’m becoming more confident in identifying how different components of a WordPress theme interact, which will be highly valuable in future roles involving front-end or full-stack development.

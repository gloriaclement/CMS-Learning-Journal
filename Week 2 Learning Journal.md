### Content Insights
This week’s activities helped me discover that Joomla is a powerful and flexible CMS, capable of advanced content management. However, compared to more beginner-friendly platforms like WordPress, Joomla requires more time and hands-on practice to fully understand its structure and features.
By following the video tutorial on installing Joomla , I gained practical experience in setting up a local development environment using XAMPP and phpMyAdmin. This process gave me a deeper understanding of how content management systems interact with web servers and databases at a foundational level.
In addition, launching my site using the CloudAccess.net free hosting platform allowed me to work in a hosted Joomla environment. This introduced me to pre-installed Joomla instances and helped me practice navigating real-world scenarios, like managing content through the admin dashboard.
Through these learning activities, I explored essential Joomla features such as templates, modules, and the menu structure. This strengthened my understanding of how dynamic content is displayed on websites and how Joomla separates content from presentation.



### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
By exploring both local (XAMPP) and online (CloudAccess.net) Joomla installations, I gained hands-on experience in configuring, deploying, and managing CMS platforms. These are valuable, real-world skills that align with the expectations of entry-level roles in web development and digital project coordination.
Despite initial setbacks—such as realizing Joomla was already pre-installed on the hosting platform—I was able to overcome the duplication of work and turn it into a learning opportunity. This demonstrated resilience and the ability to adapt under time pressure, which are critical employability traits.
Successfully launching a Joomla site  not only built my confidence but also provided a tangible outcome I can include in a professional portfolio or discuss in interviews as a demonstration of my technical and problem-solving abilities.

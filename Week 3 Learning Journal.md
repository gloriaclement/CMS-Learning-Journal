## ï»¿Week 3 -Learning  Journal


### Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I focused on hands-on learning and self-directed exploration of WordPress installation and website management. The following resources were invaluable:
- Week 3 Videos on Learn JCU
- LinkedIn Learn videos


### Estimated Hours
* XAMPP control panel: This was already done in week 2, so this didn't take long, connecting to the DB (phpMyAdmin)
* WordPress installation: 30 minutes to go through instructions and install
* Website: 5 hours to go through instructions and videos on how to create pages and add images using WordPress



### Content Insights
This week deepened my understanding of how WordPress functions as a content management system (CMS). I gained practical experience installing WordPress locally using XAMPP and setting up a database with phpMyAdmin. One of the key takeaways was learning how user-friendly WordPress is, especially for non-developers. Creating pages, uploading images, and customizing themes helped me better understand how websites are structured and maintained. I also discovered the importance of organizing content logically for better user experience and navigation. Overall, this hands-on practice helped reinforce the theoretical concepts from the LearnJCU videos.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Exploring WordPress has shown me how widely used and versatile it is in the tech and digital marketing industries. Being able to install and configure WordPress, manage pages, and handle basic site customization are practical skills that are highly valued in roles such as IT support, web administration, and digital content management. This experience has boosted my confidence in using CMS platforms and has made me consider learning more about themes, plugins, and even basic HTML/CSS to expand my skill set. For my future career, these foundational web management skills will enhance my employability and open up opportunities to work on website projects or support small businesses with their online presence.

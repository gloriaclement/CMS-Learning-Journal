# Week 8 – Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources

This week, I focused on deepening my understanding of **custom theme development** within a CMS (Content Management System), specifically working with WordPress child themes.

To support my learning, I designed and ran a **learning experiment** using the **Pomodoro Technique** combined with **Work Mode settings on my phone**. My goal was to improve my concentration and retention while working through more technical aspects of CMS theme development.

Resources used:
- [WordPress Developer Handbook – Theme Development](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/)
- [LinkedIn tutorials on building custom themes](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-building-themes-from-scratch-using-underscores-2/welcome)
- Course practicals and sample theme files

## Content Insights

I explored the structure and functionality of **child themes** in WordPress, focusing on:
- `functions.php` usage
- Enqueuing styles correctly with `wp_enqueue_style()`
- Overriding template files from the parent theme
- Customizing headers, footers, and page templates

During this time, I noticed that I often lost focus or got overwhelmed when troubleshooting issues (e.g., blank pages, styling not applying). This made it a good opportunity to run my **learning experiment**.

### Learning Experiment Summary:
- **Hypothesis**: Using the Pomodoro Technique and Work Mode settings will improve my ability to focus and reduce distractions during CMS development tasks.
- **Test Setup**:
  - Two sessions using Pomodoro (25/5 method) + phone on Work Mode (blocks notifications)
  - Two sessions using my regular approach (long blocks, no app restrictions)
- **Outcome**: I stayed more focused during Pomodoro sessions, had fewer interruptions, and made fewer mistakes when editing theme files.

| Method               | Focus Time | Task Completion | Stress Level |
|----------------------|------------|------------------|--------------|
| Pomodoro + Work Mode | 80/100 min | High             | Low          |
| Regular              | 60/90 min  | Medium           | Medium       |

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

- Learning how to build and customize themes is a valuable skill for any **web developer**, especially in freelance or digital agency roles.
- Running this experiment taught me how important **structured focus** is when working with code-heavy topics—something I’ll apply in future projects.
- I’m more confident now in applying for junior roles or internships where WordPress development or CMS skills are required.
- This week also highlighted how integrating simple productivity tools (like Pomodoro timers and phone restrictions) can dramatically improve the quality of my learning time.

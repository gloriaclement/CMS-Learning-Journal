# Week 7 – Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources
This week’s practical focused on creating a basic PHP website from scratch, simulating what it’s like to build without a CMS like WordPress or Joomla. The task was to demonstrate PHP features such as echo, conditionals (if/else), repetition (for, while, foreach), functions with parameters, and includes. I used these concepts to build a fictional cake shop website called Gloria’s Cake Shop. I also used a local server setup (via XAMPP and the built-in PHP server) and externalized the CSS for clean design and code separation.

## Estimated Hours
Approximately 6 hours and 20 minutes in total:

- 2 hours planning the layout and functionality
- 3 hours coding and styling the pages
- 20 minutes troubleshooting server issues (502 Bad Gateway)
- 1 hour reflecting and documenting the learning outcomes

## Content Insights
Working directly with PHP helped me understand the fundamentals that many CMS platforms are built on. For example:

- Using include for header.php and footer.php mimics how CMS themes manage layout components.
- foreach and while loops allowed me to dynamically generate content, similar to how WordPress loops through posts.
- I used if/else to add a “Sunday Special” message, learning how dynamic logic can personalize user experience.
- Creating a custom function to greet users taught me about reusability in PHP code.
  
These concepts are abstracted away in CMS platforms, but building them manually helped me appreciate what’s happening behind the scenes


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights

This week bridged the gap between custom development and CMS usage. As someone planning to manage websites professionally, understanding the raw PHP behind CMS tools like WordPress makes me more versatile. I’ll be better prepared to troubleshoot or customize a site beyond plugin and theme limitations. This kind of back-end logic is also relevant to entry-level web development roles or internships, where PHP remains widely used. I also gained confidence using local development environments and resolving server issues, which are practical, job-ready skills.

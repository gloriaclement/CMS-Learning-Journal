# Week 10 – Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources
Across Weeks 1–9, I engaged with key web development tools and concepts, starting with the fundamentals of Content Management Systems (CMS) such as Joomla and WordPress. I explored Joomla’s content structure (articles, menus, and modules) before moving to WordPress, where I worked with themes, plugins, and the template hierarchy. I learned how PHP powers WordPress functionality and practiced editing files like functions.php. Child themes were introduced to ensure safe customisation, and I gained experience creating one from scratch. CSS was applied for responsive layouts, followed by SCSS for more maintainable styling through variables, nesting, and mixins. In later weeks, I experimented with custom starter themes (e.g., Underscores) to build themes from the ground up, incorporating PHP, hooks, and custom templates. These activities combined to strengthen my understanding of modern CMS-based web design and development workflows.

## Estimated Hours
- Weekly average: 5–7 hours  
- Total across 10 weeks: ~55–65 hours  

## Content Insights
The progression from basic CMS use to custom theme development highlighted the importance of a solid foundation in PHP, CSS, and SCSS for extending WordPress and Joomla. Joomla provided insight into a more structured, module-driven system, while WordPress demonstrated flexibility and scalability through themes and plugins. Child themes proved essential for maintaining long-term stability of websites. SCSS offered efficiency in managing large stylesheets, while custom starter themes helped me understand how professional developers structure WordPress projects from the ground up. This learning pathway connected front-end styling with back-end logic, giving me a holistic view of CMS development.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The skills developed during these weeks are directly transferable to roles in web development and IT support. Knowing how to work with Joomla and WordPress increases employability in organisations that rely on CMS platforms for content management. The ability to build and customise child themes, apply SCSS for clean styling, and use PHP for theme and plugin modifications positions me well for junior developer roles or freelance work. Additionally, the experience of working with custom starter themes mirrors industry workflows, enhancing both problem-solving and adaptability. This learning journey has also improved my confidence in independently building and maintaining websites, which supports my long-term goal of contributing to professional web projects and potential entrepreneurial ventures.

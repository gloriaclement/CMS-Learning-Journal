# Week 8: Learning Experiment

## **Title:**  
**Boosting Learning Focus with the Pomodoro Technique and Work Mode Phone Settings**

---

## Learning Activities

### Hypothesis  
Using the **Pomodoro Technique** along with activating **Work Mode** on my phone (which blocks all apps and notifications) will help me concentrate better and retain more information compared to my usual long, uninterrupted study sessions without blocking distractions.

---

### Test / Method  
This week, I ran a simple experiment to compare two different study approaches.

#### Setup A – Pomodoro + Work Mode (Experimental Method)
- Studied in **25-minute focus blocks** with **5-minute breaks**.
- Turned on **Work Mode** on my phone to block social media, messages, and notifications.
- Used a timer and kept only the learning materials open.
  
#### Setup B – Long Study Block (Control Method)
- Studied for **90 minutes straight**, with no breaks.
- Phone was left in **Auto work mode**, turning off all notifications and access to apps.

#### Data Collected
For both methods, I recorded:
- **Actual focus time** (measured using a timer)
- **Post-session quiz scores** to assess retention
- **Self-rated energy and focus level** (on a scale of 1 to 10)

###  Results

| Study Method             | Avg. Focus Time | Avg. Quiz Score | Energy/Focus Rating |
|--------------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Pomodoro + Work Mode     | 80 / 100 mins     | 88%              | 8.5 / 10             |
| Long Uninterrupted Study | 60 / 90 mins      | 72%              | 6 / 10               |

- **Pomodoro + Work Mode** significantly reduced distractions.
- The short breaks kept my mind fresh and helped maintain concentration.
- I was more focused and scored higher on quizzes compared to the usual method.
- Regular sessions led to mental fatigue and temptations to check my phone.

## Learning Insights
- Turning on **Work Mode** was a small change but had a big impact. Blocking notifications made a noticeable difference in my ability to focus.
- The **Pomodoro Technique** helped me stay on task without feeling drained.
- I used to think longer sessions meant more productivity, but **structured focus with breaks** led to better learning outcomes.
- I’ll continue using this method for future study sessions, especially during revision and technical topics.

## Next Steps
I plan to fine-tune this method by experimenting with different Pomodoro intervals and adding brief movement/stretching breaks during the 5-minute rest periods.
